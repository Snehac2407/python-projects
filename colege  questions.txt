15. Write a program to print table for numbers between 2 to 10.

.	Write a function to generate nth Fibonacci number.

2.	Write a function to generate prime numbers between range [a, b].

3.	Write a function to print factorial of all the number from 1 to n.

4.	Write a function to find sum of n natural numbers.

5.	Write a function to reverse digits of given number.

6.	Write a function to check if the given number is a perfect number or not.

7.	Write a function that converts a decimal number to binary number.

8.	Write a function prodDigits() that takes a number and returns the product of digits of that number.

9.	Define a function which counts vowels and consonant in a word.

10.	Write a function to convert the given word into lowercase.

11.	Write a function to validate username and password to some predefined values and return True/False as a result of validation.

12.	Write a function to check if given number is autotrophic or not. (Automorphic number are those numbers whose last digit is same as square of the number itself. Eg. 5, as square of 5 is 25 and last digit of 25 is 5)

13.	Write a function to check if given number is spy or not. (Spy number are those numbers where sum of their digits is equals to product of their digits. Eg. 1124)

14.	Write a function to check if given number is pronic or not. (Pronic number are those numbers which can be defined as the product of two consecutive numbers.  Eg. 6 is a pronic number as 2Ã—3=6, where 2 and 3 are two consecutive numbers. )

15.	Write a function to check if the given number is neon number or not. (a number is said to be Neon number if the sum of the digits of their square is the number itself. for example 9 is a Neon number as the square of 9 is 81 and the sum of digits of 81 is 9)
